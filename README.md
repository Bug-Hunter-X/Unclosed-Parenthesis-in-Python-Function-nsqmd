This repository contains a simple Python program demonstrating an uncommon error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition. The error leads to a `SyntaxError` during compilation, as Python cannot parse the function's structure correctly.  The solution showcases how to fix this syntax error by adding the missing closing parenthesis.
